            <p>
                My name is Stephen Magesty and I am a current employee with Build N Care. I work part-time as an ABA
                Therapist.
                I enrolled in this rutgers coding bootcamp because I would love to make a change in occupations and get
                into the
                tech world.
            </p>

            <p>I have been actively working with kids over the last few years through both my church and occupation.
                I hold a youth pastor position at my church, making me in charge of the childrens ministry.
                The reason I got into the ABA field was after I had the opportunity to work as an assistant to Steven
                Kunkel,
                who started "Life with Autism in a Non-Autistic World" in Kentucky three years ago.</p>

            <p>Steven is a man who started this company since he himself had to learn how to go
                through life
                "in a non-autistic world" as someone who is autistic. His goal was to create a community where the kids
                with
                autism in the
                Louisville area could get the attention and funding they deserve. </p>

            <p>This served as an extremely humbling
                experience to me during
                my short time in Kentucky. After coming back home to New Jersey after college, my goal was to pursue a
                job in
                that field.
